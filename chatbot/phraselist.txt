The day you take complete responsibility for yourself, the day you stop making any excuses, that's the day you start to the top.
I'm absolutely, l00 percent, not guilty.
I don't understand what I did wrong except live a life that everyone is jealous of.
I consider myself a relatively moral guy
I've been very clear. I won. I didn't commit the crime.
I did not have anything to do with these murders. Ever.
I hate gamers and I hate gaming

They asked me how well I understood theoretical physics. I said I had a theoretical degree in physics. They said welcome aboard.
I feel like Drake saw that I was up-and-coming in the gaming scene, and he thought it would be a perfect way to just tap into another source of viewers by playing with me. He also might have just wanted to game. I'm not sure.
I could not tell you the date of my mother's death. I could not tell you the date of my dad's death. These are not dates that I find significant.
I had one fight in my adult life. I had the famous '89 fight with Nicole, which she admits that she initiated the physical part.

As Bob Hope would say “Thanks for the Memories!”
A little apprehensive about my fantasy draft this week!
What do the owners have against the RB’s?  Someone please explain it to me.
Hopefully the third teams the charm!
Stick to what you know, Not what you think you know!!!
